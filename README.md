# Web Application Security Guide

Web Applications are currently the predominant source of software vulnerabilities exploited in online attacks.Quantity and importance of data entrusted to web applications is growing, and defenders need to learn how to secure them. Traditional network defences, such as firewalls, fail to secure web applications. There is a growing need and demand for web programmers to be security literate. </br>

In this guide you will learn to understand potential risks when creating a web apllication. You will also be able to reconize vulnerabilities and in that way learn how to defend your own applications from those vurnerabilities. In this guide the following subjects will be discussed: </br>
- Understand common mistakes of coders and vulnerabilities of web applications.
- Understand web application security and its importance.
- Explains how code developersâ€™ mistakes may be exploited to the benefit of the attackers and how to prevent these attacks.
- Build secure web applications using secure coding practices.

Tools used in this guide </br>
- VirtualBox, This tool is used to setup a secure test inveronment
- Postman, This tool is used for performing intergration testing with your API.

There are three specifications that are central to the web:</br>
- URL (Uniform Recourse Locators)
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- HTTP (HyperText Tranfer Protocol)
 

## HTTP</br>
In the image below you can see a represantation of how you computer connects to a server.</br>
![client-server](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24454699/56094773-b2a16280-5ec5-11e9-8373-ca946d15258f.png)
</br>
A TCP connection is created, then the browser sends a HTTP request to the server asking for the wanted document. The webserver than replies with the page content and the closes the TCP connection again.

The browser is always the initiating party and the server nervel calls back. This means that HTTP is a client/server protocol. The client in this case doesn't always have to be a browser. It can also be your typical instagram application.

The HTTP is line oriented which means that the communication takes place using strings of characters which are separated by carriage return (ASCII 13) and line feded (ASCII 10).

## GET/POST REQUESTS 
There are 2 different types of requests that can be send by the client.
### GET REQUESTS
  In this request the client asks for information. With the GET request the browser is free to resent the request, for example, this happends when the user presses the back button on a website. (this is not suitable with for example, money transfers because this will resend the transfer each time the back button is pressed) In a GET request the parameters of the request are encoded in the URL. In the image below you can find an example of the GET request. </br>

  ![get_req](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24454699/56095124-1ed19580-5ec9-11e9-9224-5692be6ffa91.png)
</br>

  The following can be said about this image: 
  - The first line shows the Request-line. In the request-lin the GET is called the method token. The HTTP is the request URI and the 1.0 is the HTTP-version identifier.
  - The lines below the request-line are the Request-header lines.
  
  After the GET request is send by the client the server will send back a responce. (see image below)</br>
  ![responce_get](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24454699/56095184-b800ac00-5ec9-11e9-91e1-076b6c2b2eb6.png)
  </br>

  The following can be said about the image above:
  - The first line is called the status line. The HTTP/1.1 is called the HTTP-version, the 200 OK is called the status code. In this case the status code is 200 which means the request is OK. Another status code which we all reconize is status code 404 NOT FOUND which means that the requested webpage is not found.
  - The lines after the status lines (encirkeld in red) are calle the Request-header lines. In these lines you can find the content length. The value (in this case 84) represents the amount of bytes that are in the requested content.
  - The lines below that (encirkeld in blue) is the content that is requested. This is written in HTML.

### POST  REQUESTS
In this request the clients sends information that changes the information currently on the server. This request cannot be resend by the client without it asking permission for it.  The parameters of a POST request are hidden.  In the image below you can find an example of a POST request. </br>
![post_req](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24454699/56095517-5fcba900-5ecd-11e9-8fe6-4c2608f5174f.png)
</br>

It's basicly the same as a GET request only in this case the method token is POST. You can also see that the content-type is an encoded form. The content-lenght is again the amoubtn of bytes posted by the request. In this case a user tries to login using the username jdoe and the password BritneySpears. This can be seen in the last line.</br>

URL encoding means that you change certain characters found in the URL by encoding them using a % sign followed by tho hexadecimal digits. (see image below)</br>

![encoded](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24454699/56095603-0617ae80-5ece-11e9-8e11-f91f98a9946d.png)
</br>

### SECURITY CONCERNS: GET/POST REQUESTS
The origin of all the requests are on the side of the client. This means that an attacker can replace the client (EX. a browser) with something completely different. For example a proxy can be used to manipulate the data sent to the server. They sit between your client (ex. your browser ) and the server. The proxy lets the attacker change the header and data before passing it to the server.</br>
A situation where this could be usefull for an attacker: </br>
A user want so send money via a bank transfer. The user wants to send the money to an account with the number 1234. The attacker changes this account number to his own account number, 4321. When the user presses send  the money will be send to account 4321 instead of account 1234.  

## REFERER HEADER 
On a request the referer header contains the url  of the website  where the document is located. This is also the case when you have an image on your website that is from another website. (in the image below you can see an example of this) </br>
![urlheader](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24454699/56095993-ebdfcf80-5ed1-11e9-942d-b6e8ec2b6705.png)
</br>
In the image above the the image used is from the website : http://www.site.example/index.html. This meanse that you use a snippit (small part) of the html code from that website. It's the same for the link below the image. 

### SECURITY CONCERN: REFERER HEADER
Because a part of the code,  from the website that has the image on it,  is used in your own website, it will  also use any JavaApplets, ActiveX scripts and plug-ins included in that  page.

## CACHING
The term Caching refers to temporarily storing documents on the client or server side to reduce the download time. When we talk about caching you can devide it in two types of chaches:
- Local cache </br>
  This is manged by the client (your browser). When the client sends a request for a type of document it saves the document on your disk. When you go to the document (the page in this case) again the loading time will be much lower because it can get the document from your local storage instead of a remote server.
- Shared cache </br>
   This cache is typically a server in the local network. If one user reads an online newspaper, and another user tries to access the same newspaper the second user will get a local copy because it was already requested by the first user.  </br>

   The image below shows the 2 types of caches: </br>

![clientservercache](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24454699/56096371-c30e0900-5ed6-11e9-87aa-d1db6e25261c.png)
</br>

### SECURITY CONCERN: CACHING
Some documents should not be cached. A few examples of those documents are:
- The stock information on a webstore. The user should always be served up to date stock information. If the information from the day before is cached and then retrieved by an user there is a possiblity the user recieves out of date stock information.
- Another situation could be in an internet cafe. If user 1 has send information on a banking website and leaves, then user 2 goes to the computer that was just used by user 1 and then presses the backbutton, user 2 will be able to retrieve the banking info of user .

The sites need a way to tell the browser and proxies to not save these kind of documents. This is done in the HTTP headers. Different versions of HTTP apply different mechanisms for cache control. This means that an older version of HTTP could also be a security consern.

## COOKIES
HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that there are no connections to previous request made by the same client. To create a connection (state) between these requests we make use of cookies. Cookies are an extension of HTTP to give us just the state, So with cookies the webserver asks the client to remember a small piece of information. This info is passed back by the client on each request to the same server.</br>

An example of a cookie is: On google search the user can set the amount of results returned by a google search. The cookie makes sure the amount set by the user is remember each time the user does a search on google.</br>

The HTTP header is used for both setting and returning the cookies. When the server want the client to remember a cookie it passes a Set-Cookie Header in the response. The image below is an example of a Set-Cookie Header. </br>

![set_cookie_header](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24454699/56096540-14b79300-5ed9-11e9-8a07-1c79ca99142e.png)
</br>

The cookie is then returned using something called the cookie header. (see image below)</br>

![cookieheader](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24454699/56096566-7415a300-5ed9-11e9-8cfd-22d7d749cfac.png)
</br>

### SECURITY CONCERN: COOKIES
Using cookies comes in very handy. There are some security concerns it brings with them. The concerns are as follows:
- Cookies may be limited in size, this means that space consuming states cannot be safely represented using cookies.
- Cookies are handled on the client-side, as we know right know client-side stuff can be manipulated by users with bad intentions. 

Solving these concerns can be done by storing the cookie information on the server side.

## SESSIONS
Session are a collection of variables that make up a state. They are located on the server-side. To make sure the session is associated with the correct client a session ID is passed on each request to the server. So the session ID uniquely identifies with one session object on the server. </br>
The image below shows a visual represantation of a session object. </br>

![SessionID](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24454699/56096940-cb1d7700-5edd-11e9-927f-71faa21290d6.png)
</br>

### SESSION HIJACKING
These days a lot of websites use session based login. This means a session is initiated when the user has given a valid username and password. But what if someone gets access to the session ID of the user thats logged in? </br>
In this case the attacker would not need the password of the victim since the session ID works as a temporarily replacement for the password.
