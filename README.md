Web Application Security Guide

Web Applications are currently the predominant source of software vulnerabilities exploited in online attacks.Quantity and importance of data entrusted to web applications is growing, and defenders need to learn how to secure them. Traditional network defences, such as firewalls, fail to secure web applications. There is a growing need and demand for web programmers to be security literate. </br>

In this guide you will learn to understand potential risks when creating a web apllication. You will also be able to reconize vulnerabilities and in that way learn how to defend your own applications from those vurnerabilities. In this guide the following subjects will be discussed:
- Understand common mistakes of coders and vulnerabilities of web applications.
- Understand web application security and its importance.
- Explains how code developersâ€™ mistakes may be exploited to the benefit of the attackers and how to prevent these attacks.
- Build secure web applications using secure coding practices.
